# micropython-mcu-multisensor

The idea for this project came from:
https://github.com/bruhautomation/ESP-MQTT-JSON-Multisensor

I decided to put togeather some MicroPython code to provide similar funcionality.  Not really due to any real issues with
the orignal project but to learn.

I found this diagram useful:
